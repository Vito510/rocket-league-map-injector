# rocket-league-map-injector
Makes it easier to play custom maps on the epic games version of the game. 

python 3+ required

Do anything you want with the code just dont criticize for my shit code. And also dont just blatantly steal my code (even though it's shit).

In the folder "MapFolders" you put extracted map folders.

In a map folder there can only be the map file ".udk,upk.....etc"
The folder can be named anything you want.

Q: where can I find maps, epic games does not have a workshop?
A: https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/ on this website paste the steam workshop link for the map you want to play you dont need the game on steam for this to work.
